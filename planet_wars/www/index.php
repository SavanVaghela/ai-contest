<h2>Final Rankings</h2>
<p>Congratulations to this term's winner, <a href="http://quotenil.com/">
  Gábor Melis</a>! Whereas the Google AI Challenge has traditionally been
  dominated by entries written in languages like
  <a href="http://ai-contest.com/language_profile.php?lang=C%2B%2B">C++</a>,
  Gábor has solidly taken the top spot with an innovative algorithm. His
  entry is one of just 33 submissions written in
  <a href="http://ai-contest.com/language_profile.php?lang=Lisp">Lisp</a>,
  and is entitled <a href="http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=8565">
  bocsimacko</a>. Congratulations Gábor!</p>
<p>A big congratulations also goes out to the runners up,
  <a href="http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=7026">_iouri_</a> and
  <a href="http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=11248">Slin-.-</a>,
  as well as all the finalists in the top 100. With over 4600 submissions
  received, securing a spot in the top 100 was no easy task!</p>
<p>On behalf of <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and the
  <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo Computer
  Science Club</a>, we would like to thank everybody who took part in the
