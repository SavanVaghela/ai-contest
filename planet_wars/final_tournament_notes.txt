Final tournament start checklist:

At submission deadline, 11-27 23:59 (CST, i.e. server time?), stop submissions by:
    In file add "Sorry submissions are closed..." after submission rules and disable form
    In file check_submit.php uncomment "$errors[] = "Nuh-uh..." line (line 46)

Add line to create_matchups.py startup to have it immediately exit; remember that api_get_matchup.php will call it directly

Wait and then verify queue of pending matches is clear in mysql matchups table

Modify archive_games.py to move all games to games_archive table and run it

Verify games table is empty

Run update_rankings.sh twice and verify the two most recent leaderboards in the database have no player rankings

Verify that all contest organizer player accounts do not have an active submission
