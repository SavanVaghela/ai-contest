#summary The project's style guide for C++ code.

=C++ Style Guide=

This project adheres to the [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml Google C++ Style Guide], with a few exceptions:
  * *class method names*: start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word, with no underscores.

==Why Have a Style Guide?==

Check out the Background section of the [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml Google C++ Style Guide].

==But My Style Convention is Better for Reasons X==

You're probably right. However, having a convention is more important than which particular convention is better.

==But I Strongly Disagree with Certain Provisions for Reasons that Make Good Sense==

Please follow the style guide faithfully anyways. It really is important to have a consistent codebase, even if the style guide isn't perfect. Truly awesome coders eagerly adapt their style to match the project they are contributing to.
