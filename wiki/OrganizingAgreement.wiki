This agreement is meant to make organizers/planning volunteers understand their responsibilities.


= Agreement =

*This agreement applies to:*
  * volunteers that help with the contest in a significant way
  * members of ConCom and SysCom in CSClub
  * any other person that has knowledge of the internals of the contest.

By helping in this contest, volunteers need to understand the downsides of participating.

*What a volunteer should NOT do:*
 * participate in the contest, *most important*. This could be seen as a conflict of interest and could harm the contest.
 * disclose information that will give an unfair advantage to contest participants.
 * disclose information that might hinder security for any part of the contest.
 * disclose information that was not cleared to be shared with the public.

*Please Note:* Even though with these limitations, our past volunteers had a *great experience doing this*. There's opportunities to help people, come up with ideas. This volunteering also looks great on a resume.
