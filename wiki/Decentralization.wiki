#summary How to get the contest run on multiple servers.

= Introduction =

My idea is basically to stop running the bots on our only server available.
Move all the sandboxes on other servers that were volunteered, these servers don't necessarily need a lot of bandwidth(ex: hypertriangle.com, corn-syrup, a few others). The main server can still have mysqld, httpd and the Tournament Manager, but it doesn't have to consume its CPU for the bots.


= Details =
Each of the servers could have a sandbox setup, and have the main server ssh in a sandbox, copy the bot in it, then run it. Each volunteered node could have multiple of these sandboxes. Example: ssh hypertriangle.com -p 4201 could access the first sandbox on hypertriangle.


= Issues =
 * Uploading/Dowloading of bots to the sandboxes could consume too much bandwidth for the main server. *Comeback:* bandwidth for the server is 4TB/month, bandwidth for hypertriangle is 200GB/month, the nodes will have that issue much sooner.

*Implication for node owners:*
 * They can't compete.
 * There might be security problems associated with this.
