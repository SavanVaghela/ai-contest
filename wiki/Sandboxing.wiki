#summary Discusses several methods for sandboxing untrusted code.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

==What is Sandboxing?==

In our programming contests, contestants submit their code using a web interface. The code is then compiled and run by our servers. This presents several security issues. A malicious or careless person may submit code that attempts to:
  * delete files
  * make network connections to outside servers
  * spawn an extraordinary number of threads (forkbomb)
  * interfere with other submissions
  * connect to or wreck the contest's database
  * any number of other nasty things

It is for this reason that we need to run untrusted code inside a "sandbox", or "padded cell". The sandbox prevents untrusted programs from doing bad things. There are several different ways to sandbox untrusted code.

==Ptrace==

Ptrace can be used to sandbox untrusted code by intercepting potentially harmful system calls. However, this approach has been judged to be unsuitable because:
  * it is difficult to follow the execution of a program through multiple threads
  * systrace basically does the same thing anyways, except it's easier to use
