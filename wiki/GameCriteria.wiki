#summary Some guidelines for evaluating and comparing game ideas.

=Game Criteria=

Whenever we put on a new contest, the first step is to choose a contest problem. In these AI contests, the problem generally takes the form of a simple game. This page contains some guidelines and criteria for evaluating the quality of proposed contest problems.

==Easy==

Hard problems are scary.

==Familiar==

People are more likely to participate in a contest if they are more familiar with the problem. Familiar games include Rock Paper Scissors, Chess, Survivor, and Billiards. Unfamiliar games include Least Unique Positive Integer and Blokus.

The key questions are
  * What percentage of people recognize the game's name?
  * What percentage of people would call themselves somewhat familiar with the rules or basic premise of the game?

Here, "people" is understood to mean "people who have at least basic programming experience".
