=Game Criteria=

Whenever we put on a new contest, the first step is to choose a contest problem. In these AI contests, the problem generally takes the form of a simple game. This page contains some guidelines and criteria for evaluating the quality of proposed contest problems.

Whenever making an argument about the quality of a game, consider referring to these criteria or some other reasonable set of criteria. Whenever attempting to argue that some game is better than another game, consider structuring your argument around these criteria.

==Easy==

Hard problems are scary. Even if a problem is familiar and interesting, people will still walk away if they think that
  * they are unable to create a serious entry, or
  * it would take too much time to create a serious entry.

==Familiar==

People are more likely to participate in a contest if they are more familiar with the problem. Familiar games include Rock Paper Scissors, Chess, Survivor, and Billiards. Unfamiliar games include Least Unique Positive Integer and Blokus.

The key questions are
  * What percentage of people recognize the game's name?
  * What percentage of people would call themselves somewhat familiar with the rules or basic premise of the game?

Here, "people" is understood to mean "people who have at least basic programming experience". We don't care whether your mom would recognize the game, because there's no way she is going to participate in the contest anyways.
