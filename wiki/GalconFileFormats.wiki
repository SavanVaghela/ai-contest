#summary Overview and specification of file formats used in the Galcon contest.

=Galcon File Formats=

This page contains a specification of all the file formats used in the Galcon contest. Currently, there are two. The Point-in-Time Format is used to communicate the state of a game of Galcon at a given point of time. It is also used to specify Galcon maps, since maps are a starting state for a game. The Game Playback format is used to record an entire game of Galcon, for later playback and visualization.
